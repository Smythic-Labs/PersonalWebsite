## Installation

Clone this repo into a new project folder and run install script.
(You will probably want to delete the .git/ directory and start version control afresh.)

$ git clone git@github.com:TronoTheMerciless/PersonalWebsite.git new-project
$ cd new-project
$ npm install
$ npm run dev
```

With yarn
```sh
$ git clone git@github.com:TronoTheMerciless/PersonalWebsite.git new-project

Open http://localhost:3000 and start modifying the code in /src.
(An example using Routing is provided in the `navigation` branch)
